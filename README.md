### Best Practices for Contributors

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! We encourage you to help us improve the project by focusing on the following guidelines:

1. **Focus on Bug Fixes and Issue Resolutions**:  
   Our primary goal is to maintain the integrity of the code as it reflects the progress of the YouTube course. We highly encourage contributions that address **bugs** or resolve **open issues**. These are valuable and will help keep the project in good shape for other learners. Please prioritize fixing bugs or resolving issues that are already listed or that you may discover during your work.

2. **Keep Changes Small**:  
   When submitting a pull request, try to keep your changes focused and small. Smaller pull requests are easier to review and integrate, which ensures faster feedback and smoother collaboration. If you're working on multiple improvements or bug fixes, itâ€™s better to submit them as separate pull requests instead of bundling them together.

3. **Improvements via Forks**:  
   If you're looking to make improvements or add features beyond bug fixes, please fork this repository. This repo is designed to reflect the timeline of the YouTube course, and any enhancements or changes outside of bug fixes should be handled through forks. Once you've made your changes, feel free to submit a pull request from your forked repository.

4. **Maintaining the Project Timeline**:  
   To preserve the learning timeline associated with the course, only bug fixes and issue-related pull requests will be accepted here. All other contributions should go through your fork, ensuring the main repository remains focused on its educational purpose.

Thank you for your contributions, and we look forward to collaborating with you!
